 # Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions
 
  - From the Duckett HTML book:
    - Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
      - Links using the a tag 
      - relative links using the file structure 
      - links to on-page anchors using the id tag and # in the href
    - [Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)](http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15/)
      - types of positioning for block elements: 
        - normal flow (new line) using position: static;
        - relative position using position:relative and setting the top / left / right / bottom attributes which will be from the spot where it would have been in normal flow
        - absolute positioning using the position:absolute and setting top/left/right/bottom which will be from the top of the page
        - fixed positioning (like absolute but relative to the page) using position: fixed to keep something in the position of whatever the page is displaying (like sticky headers)
        - z-index: higher index shoes up above lower index. can use this instead of following strict code-order where lower elements in the html file will sit on top of higher up elements. 
        - floating: float the element and all other elements will flow around it. 
Note: This layout chapter is BIG. Focus your attention on understanding the core concepts presented on pp.358-364, and look at the code samples on the website that accompanies the textbook. You will have another reading assignment on this chapter, so do not try to digest it all now.

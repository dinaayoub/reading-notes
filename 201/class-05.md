# Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

- From the Duckett HTML book:
  - Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
    - using img src, alt, title, height, width
    - align has been removed in html5 and you should use css instead. can use float. 
    - consider using figure and figcaption
  - Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
    - can be in rgb, hex codes, or standard color names
    - foreground = color
    - background = background-color
    - CCS3:
      - opacity 0-1 value with 1 being completely opaque
      - HSL: hue saturation lightness alpha. 
        - hue is expressed as an angle between 0 and 360
        - saturation is a percentage 0-1
        - lightness is a percentage 0-1 with 50% being the color, and 0 being white, and 1 being black 
        - alpha is to express transparency, with 0.5% being 50% transparency, so 0% is not transparent at all. 
  - Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
    - Typeface (serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy)
    - Weight (light, medium , bold, black) 
    - Style (Normal, italic, oblique - which is like italic but without any cursive element. just slanted normal font)

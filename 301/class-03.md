# Read: 03 - Flexbox and Templating

[Templating with Mustache](https://medium.com/@1sherlynn/javascript-templating-language-and-engine-mustache-js-with-node-and-express-f4c2530e73b2)
I found Mustache.js very confusing as a concept. It seems like it is a json file written in a way specified by Mustache, which then you use a templating engine to create an output. I think i'll need to google some examples of this to really understand its usage.

This is so cool! I have not used flexboc before, so it seems really nice as a way to create responsive designs without the nightmare that is float :)
A few of the key concepts:
* flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
* flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
* flex-flow: column wrap;  // default is row nowrap
* justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
* align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;

I have not been able to complete this yet as it doesn't work well on mobile *can't "hover" and long clicks or clicks didn't work.

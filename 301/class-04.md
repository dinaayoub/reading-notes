* [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - Pay particular attention to the cheatsheet
This website is a little overwhelming at first. I have no idea what half the things in the cheatsheet mean. but after looking at regex101 i understood regexr and could test it out. Pretty cool!

I found this one much easier to understand as a beginner than RegExr.com.
It's a bit confusing to me that end$ matches a string that ends with end. I guess i sort of expected *end to be something that ends with end, and end* to be something that starts with end. I think the regular expressions i studied 16+ years ago might be outdated (or more likely, my memory is faulty).

* [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/)
More newbie friendly i think.

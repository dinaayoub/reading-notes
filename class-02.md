  Superscript: <sup>, for example Nth
  Subscript: <sub>, for example: CO2
  White space collapsing
  Line breaks: <br/> to get a new line
  Horizontal line: <hr> to get a horizontal rule 
  Strong & Emphasis: <strong> for bold and <em> for italics
  Quotations: <blockquote> for big block of quotation, and avoid using <q> as it doesn't add the quotation marks in internet explorer.

  Citation: <cite>Not a name</cite>
  Define a term: <dfn>blah</dfn>

# Read: Class 12 - Socket.io

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this? Because it does not have any acknowledgement of a connection. it just sends data.
3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? Yes, i think, with multiple clients.
4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? No, I think, because a client connects to the server on one socket?
5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? yes.

## Vocabulary Terms

* Observer Pattern
* Listener: listens for an event to happen then calls the callback function.
* Event Handler: when an event happens while our listener is listening for it, it handles the event
* Event Driven Programming: programming that relies on events to trigger actions when appropriate.
* Event Loop:
* Event Queue
* Call Stack: the stack of function calls that is executed in FILO order.
* Emit/Raise/Trigger: What a function does to inform listeners that an event has happened.
* Subscribe:
* database: somewhere we can store large amounts of data, can be relational or nosql (like mongo)

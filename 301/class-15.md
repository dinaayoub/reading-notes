# Read: 15 - Diversity and Inclusion

* Consider the history: [Silicon Valleyâ€™s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/)
This article talks about how women in computer science were on the rise in the 70s and early 80s, and argues that the drop that came afterward was a result of the computer gaming industry's focus on male-centric advertisement after the gaming recession which left them with only some boys as their main audience. These advertisements (and even product names, like Game Boy) sometimes even made fun of women's lack of computer abilities, which shifted the culture - making women and girls feel like they don't belong in the computer science space. And with interest curbed before even entering college, this widened the experience gap between young men and young women. Women are also more likely to leave the 'bro' culture of tech behind after spending time in the industry.

This is quite sad, especially since I know these are the overall numbers, not the engineering/product team positions in those companies, which are *much* worse on gender equality and black/latino representation. For example, it says that amazon has 21% Black workers, but that's definitely only true because of their lower-paying jobs like warehouse workers, and is not even close to true of their well-paying engineering positions. The only minority that is clearly over-represented in tech is Asian, though they're not quite as over-represented the further up the chain you go.

  * Diversity makes teams smarter and more creative, based on many studies.
  * Diverse companies perform better - there's a strong correlation between diversity and financial outcomes.
  * Companies are missing out on great talent if they aren't hiring with diversity in mind.
  * Diverse companies can server their diverse users better
  * It's the right thing to do! Not sure why this one needs to be stated, but I guess privelege is blinding sometimes.

# Ethics in Tech

## Self Driving Cars

[Ethics of a self-driving car](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

* The really interesting question is one that will be rare to happen in reality, but has huge consequences when it does. How do you decide who lives or died in a no-win situation?
* And overall are we willing to take the risk of a computer making the wrong 'moral' choice, if on average self driving cars save lives? If you're a utalitarian, you would probably say yes to that question :).
* How do we attempt to legislate this? Right now it's "illegal" for an automated car to make a decision in favor of one person against another in terms of the car attempting to save the rider's life as a priority.
* And while most people agree the cars should do what's best for the greater good (aka kill the least number of people), they're also very unlikely to buy a car that would sacrifice them for the greater good which could significantly slow adoption.
* On the other side, is this whole dilemma contrived, since that's actually not something we expect human drivers to answer anyway? we could even argue that malfunctions like those that happen to normal cars would be more rare with self driving cars because the car would alert you sooner if it's smart enough to figure out the issues (whereas, I personally have no clue what's going on when I get into the car :))
* There could be some real benefit to society with self-driving cars - not only could we reduce traffic (and hence pollution), but we could also save lots of lives by simply substituting our poor eyesight for that of the car's, which would have much better night vision capabilities than we do as humans.
* In all cases, it seems there will be some legal battles coming and a lot of new legislation that could contradict itself since there are infinite possibilities of situations that might happen, and the cars would have to decide every time.
* There are many more questions to answer, and things to consider like machine learning that could make the car 'learn' how to respond to different situations better.
* I agree with the rebuttals in the article because I think self-driving cars will ultimately make the world a less dangerous place. No more drunk drivers, or vision problems. No further need to own a second car when you can just all cheaply car share because the car can go where it needs to go automatically- think of how much that would help the planet, too. As long as the car makes a reasonable decision, I think it's still important technology to push forward.

## Microsoft employees and ICE

[Microsoft employees demand end of ICE-contract](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

* Microsoft touted their work with ICE in a blog post as a way to show the success of their technologies, but that backfired when the child separation policy started.
* Microsoft employees objected and demanded that Microsoft end its $19.4 million contract with ICE and in response microsoft announced that its tech was not involved in the child separation policy, and that they were dismayed by that policy.
* Some employees were not happy with this really mild rebuke of that inhumane policy and have been trying to organize to pressure microsoft into ending its contracts with government agencies that do morally questionable things, like ICE.
* I agree with the employees that tech companies should not be enabling unethical policies like child separation and should immediately halt those contracts. And really, what is $20 million for Microsoft? a drop in the ocean. They should have ended that ICE contract.

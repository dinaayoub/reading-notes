# Read - Class 10: Stacks & Queues

## Stacks

- Last in first out (LIFO)
- push will add to the top of the stack
- pop will remove from the top of the stack
- top is a pointer to the top of the stack
- peek allows us to look at the value at the top of the stack
- isEmpty checks whether the stack has any items in it

## Queues

- first in first out (FIFO)
- enqueue will add an item to the end of the queue
- dequeue will remove an item from the start of the queue
- Front is the first item in the queue (the one we would dequeue)
- Read is the last item in the queue (where we would enqueue)
- peek will give us the value of the first item in the queue
- isEmpty checks whether the queue has any items in it

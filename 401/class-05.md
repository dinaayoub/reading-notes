# Implementation: Linked Lists

* [Read: Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)
  * Big O(n) for traversal, Big O(1) for storage to add a node.
  * Adding a node at head is O(1) but at end is O(n)

* [Read: What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt1](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-1-d8b7e6508b9d)
  * Can be scattered throughout memory unlike arrays that need to be a contiguous block in memory
  * Linear data structures
  * can be singly linked, doubly linked, circular... etc
    * is circular a bug or a feature? :)

* [Read: What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt2](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-2-131d96f71996)
  * O(1) constant time
  * O(n) linear
  * O(n^2) exponential (bad!!)

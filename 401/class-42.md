# Read 42: Gatsby, next.js, and other JS Frameworks

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does React Native do when it builds your application?
It builds your code into different apps that interact natively with the different OSes Android and iOS, plus the web.
2. Can you simply deploy a react web app to the phone?
Not exactly. It needs some modifications to be a react native app.

## Vocabulary Terms

* eject: I still don't know what this term means relative to react.
* android avd: the virtual device manager for android studio that allows you to emulate an android phone on your computer.
* expo: a framework that allows us to develop react native apps, deploy and run them on web, android and ios.

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
React native in general. I had heard about it but didn't know what it meant.
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
I would love it if we could actually get my machine working correctly with android AVD :)
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
I want to try recreating my android app in react native. If i can, that would be wonderful so I can make it available for iOS users!
